AI Trip Planner
Overview: The AI Trip Planner is an intelligent travel planning application designed to streamline the process of organizing trips, vacations, or business travel. The app leverages artificial intelligence to offer personalized itineraries based on user preferences such as budget, travel dates, preferred destinations, and travel companions. By integrating external APIs like Google Places, users can explore destinations, accommodations, and points of interest, ensuring a smooth and tailored travel experience.

Key Features:

Personalized Itineraries: The AI engine curates day-by-day travel plans based on the user’s preferences for budget, number of travel days, travel party size, and location.

Destination Search: Users can search for and select travel destinations using Google Places Autocomplete, ensuring accurate and comprehensive information about the selected destination.

Budget Planning: The app provides options to set a travel budget, and based on this input, it suggests accommodations, activities, and dining options that fit within the user’s financial constraints.

Travel Companions: The app allows users to specify who they are traveling with (solo, friends, family, etc.), enabling the AI to recommend family-friendly or group-specific activities.

Accommodation Recommendations: Integration with hotel APIs provides users with detailed information about hotels, including pricing, amenities, ratings, and reviews. Users can browse hotel options and select their preferred stay.

Dynamic Trip Adjustments: Users can modify their trip details in real time, adjusting destinations, budgets, or trip durations. The app dynamically updates the recommendations and itinerary accordingly.

Dark Mode Integration: The app includes a dark mode for a comfortable user experience in low-light settings, with responsive and intuitive design adjustments to cater to different screen sizes.

User Account and Trip Management: Users can create accounts via Google Sign-In and manage their trips in the "My Trips" section. They can view past trips, save future plans, and edit current travel details.

Interactive UI: The user interface is built with modern technologies like React and TailwindCSS, ensuring a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
